# 2. Connecting to a data source

You will need to replace the `API_KEY` in `package.json` with the one you have obtained from [get.linkurio.us](https://get.linkurio.us).

You will need an instance of neo4j running and replace the `HOST`, `DB_NAME` and `PASSWORD` constants to connect to it.

```
npm i
npm start
```

It will start a development server with you application at http://localhost:9000
